    <p><b>The backgrounds were made by Marnix van Leeuwen.</b>
      <br><br>
       "We decided on some colour palettes we wanted to implement in the game, from purple to red to orange. We wanted each environment to have it's own feeling but still match the style of the game. I tried to make all the colours look different per scene but still look similar enough to harness the feeling of the same world in every environment.  I also wanted the world to feel dead and infected, that's why I included a big graveyard and many dead trees and abandoned houses. The infection had taken over the world, the backgrounds showed this pretty well without saying any words I think."

    <p><b>Character and enemy art was done by Senne Oogink.</b>
      <br><br>
       "We decided to make the main character a plague doctor. I played around with the characteristic elements of the original plague doctors, like the mask, hat and cape. I left out the long coat since so you can really see the movement from the character. For the enemy's we went with a dead pale colour since they are supposed to represent infected and deformed humans. The infected parts are from simiulair colour palettes as the enviroments so it all ties nicely together. We used cel shading/ toon shading for a detailed feeling."

    <p><b>The UI and promotional solutions were brought to life by Filip Radev.</b>
      <br><br>
       "With 'The Blood Night' the overall idea and feel of the game was inspired
       by the outbreak of the Black Death during the Medieval Times. We further
       twisted the idea of the game by creating monsters out of the infection and
       a guild of hunters- mainly witch doctors, who would fight back the infection"
