        <li><b>Senne Oogink</b>, "I was the character artist and animator for this project. I also worked on some other bits and pieces for the project. I really wanted to do characters this project since I hadn't done that for any other project before. I thought the animating part was really fun at first, but it does get tiring after a while and makes it hard to keep going. But I have learned a lot about it and after a break from animating I would definitely pick it up again."</li>
        <li><b>Marnix van Leeuwen</b>, "For this project I was in charge of the backgrounds and the tiles. I liked doing it because I have a passion for making fantasy worlds come alive. It was a bit different than what I'm used to but fun to do. I also did some small colouring on certain HUD elements and that's about it.  It was a fun challenge to create an arcade game, since arcade games work rather differently than the AAA games most of us are used to. I learned quite a bit about what's important for these types of games and would gladly do it again."</li>
        <li><b>Lars Wille</b>, "As a designer, my tasks were the Target Group Research, UX/UI design, Narrative Designer and Music/sound design. The last one proved itself more difficult then I initially thought at first, because of the overall amount of websites and such where you can find royalty free music/sounds. This experience made me learn not to underestimate the tasks that are laid before me. In the end I had fun doing this task and had fun working with my teammates. Iâ€™d say the project was a challenge but it was a fun one."</li>
        <li><b>Nicolas Garcia</b>, "My role for this project was Engineer, in which I mainly focused on the game programming. And help if needed with the Website. I worked a long with Freek Pluim which has been a great experience working with him in this project. We worked together on all the problems we encountered. We divided the work evenly that way, he worked on some things and i worked on other making the project progress rapidly. I had a great experience with my team, Designers and Artist made a great job. If anyone had any spear time they always asked if they could help with anything else."</li>
        <li><b>Filip Radev</b>, "Hey, I am Filip, an artist, and for this project I have been working on  the promotional solutions: the 3D case design, 3D controller, the UI/HUD visualisation and the poster for our game 'The Blood Night'. I worked alongside with a great team and had a lot of fun along the project. During the making of ' The Blood Night' I was able to practice and further improve my 3D modelling skills for which I am greatful. I also learnt a lot of by doing research on arcade machines, on how to make arcade controllers and the psychology behind it. This project, was a challenge for me compared to the previous ones due to the amount and type of work I had to do, however, this really helped me broaden my current skillset!"</li>
        <li><b>Freek Pluim</b>, "My name is Freek. My job is to (Together with Nicolas) make the game working as the Engineers of this project. Me and Nicolas worked most part on the game and jumped in to help with the website whenever needed. Overall in this project i have learned a lot and it was a great pleasure working with this whole group and especially Nicolas. I feel like everybody did a great job and i'm glad that they where my teammates."</li>
        <li><b>Oebe Rademaker</b>, "I was one of the designers in this project. It was a bit hard for me at first because there was no real story or anything like that to create. That is also what I liked because it was a very unique experience once again. I learned to think about making a game in another way.
          During the project I have worked on the UI/HUD concepts, website, level design, storyboard and the rules&mechanics. The project was really fun, the team I got to work with was great and we had a very good time. I would love to work on a game like this again."</li>
